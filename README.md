# OLED-Saver

Watchface for Wear OS (formerly Android Wear) that randomly moves the time around to avoid burn-in on OLED displays. Minimal resource usage.

On square screens, the full text will always be visible on-screen. On round screens, it will sometimes be cut off (currently).

### Why?

I don't like having to remember to change my watchface, but I want the always-on display.
I've already had to return it once for burn-in and I don't want to deal with that again.

I tried some similar faces made with facer and other apps, but they all seem to make the watch even slower. So I decided I wanted something native and lightweight. 
You can't get much ligher than this app.

My battery is usually around 50% at the end of the day.
